                    → The Dwarves were made by Aulë, whom they themselves called Mahal, meaning “maker.” Aulë was
                    unwilling
                    to
                    wait for the coming of the Children of Ilúvatar, for he was impatient & desired to have someone to
                    teach his lore & crafts. Therefore, he made the first Seven Fathers of the Dwarves in secret in a
                    hall
                    under the mountains of Middle-earth.←

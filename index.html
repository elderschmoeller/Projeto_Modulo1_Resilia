                    The history of Middle-earth, as described in The Silmarillion, began when the Ainur entered Arda, following
                    the creation events in the Ainulindalë and long ages of labour throughout Eä, the fictional universe. Time
                    from that point was measured using Valian Years, though the subsequent history of Arda was divided into
                    three time periods using different years, known as the Years of the Lamps, the Years of the Trees and the
                    Years of the Sun. A separate, overlapping chronology divides the history into 'Ages of the Children of
                    Ilúvatar'. The first such Age began with the Awakening of the Elves during the Years of the Trees (by which
                    time the Ainur had already long inhabited Arda) and continued for the first six centuries of the Years of
                    the Sun. All the subsequent Ages took place during the Years of the Sun.
            
                    Arda is, as critics have noted, "our own green and solid Earth at some quite remote epoch in the past." As
                    such, it has not only an immediate story but a history, and the whole thing is an "imagined prehistory" of
                    the Earth as it is now.
